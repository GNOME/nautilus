         * finishing.
         *
         * For example, the search engine restarts itself if the client starts a
         * new search before all the search providers finished its current ongoing search.
         *
         * A real use case of this is when the user change quickly the query of the search,
         * the search engine stops all the search providers, but given that each search
         * provider has its own thread it will be actually stopped in a unknown time.
         * To fix that, the search engine marks itself for restarting if the client
         * starts a new search and not all providers finished. Then it will emit
         * its finished signal and restart all providers with the new search.
         *
         * That can cause that when the search engine emits its finished signal,
         * it actually relates to old searchs that it stopped and not the one
         * the client started lately.
         * The client doesn't have a way to know wheter the finished signal
         * relates to its current search or with an old search.
         *
         * To fix this situation, provide with the signal a status parameter, that
         * provides a hint of how the search engine stopped or if it is going to realize
         * some action afterwards, like restarting.
