VH-Man2html - Modified Verhoeven-man2html
-----------------------------------------

vh = Richard Verhoeven's (rcb5@win.tue.nl) Man2html as modified and
packaged by Michael Hamilton.

Featues:
  - Translate man pages to html from tbl/troff source.
  - Look up a page by name and section or via full path name.
  - Links generated html to other pages, include files, email addresses, 
    and http refs.
  - Name-title index built from man whatis info.
  - Name only index built from inspecting the man directories.
  - Full text search via glimpse (glimpse obtainable separately). 
  - Works from man and BSD mandoc source files.
  - Fast troff to HTML translator written in C.
  - Copes with compressed (gzip etc) source.

New in version 1.5:
  - fix to mansec for compressed pages.
  - make now configures ALL scripts, html files, and man pages.
  - includes section 9.

New in version 1.4:
  - Uses /etc/man.config to obtain the man path.
  - Man2html.c now uses decompression filters specified in /etc/man.config.
  - Glimpse now uses decompression filters (see glimpse_filters file).
    (Generating indexes will be be slower for compressed hierarchies.)
  - Safer - more secure from memory overuns.  Man2html now checks for 
    excessively long input parameters.
  - All configuration can now be done by editing the Makefile and the
    glimpse_filters file.
  - By default (in version 1.4 and above) -M only allows the user to select 
    what part of the hierarchy to search first - they cannot specify a path
    outside of the official hierarchy.  Previously the -M option could be
    used to retrieve any man/mandoc source file that had "man" in it's 
    path-name/file-name (a compile time switch can restore the previous 
    behaviour).
  - Fixed more bugs.

QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

To use these cgi scripts all you have to do is install the rpm and
then point your web browser at

 http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html 

You can either save this location as a bookmark or use an editor to
insert the following lines into an appropriate place in
/usr/doc/HTML/calderadoc/caldera.html (or somewhere like
/home/httpd/index.html if you are using RedHat's http server)

 <H3><A HREF="http:/cgi-bin/man2html"><IMG SRC="book2.gif">
 Linux Manual Pages</A></H3>

For some of the indexes to work you must generate the necessary
databases...

Vh-man2html's manwhatis CGI-script uses the /usr/man/whatis file to build
a man page index.  Caldera 1.0 normally builds the /usr/man/whatis every
morning at 3:21am.  If this job has never been run (perhaps because
you turn your machine off at night), you can build it by becoming the
root user and entering:

 /usr/sbin/makewhatis /usr/man /usr/X11R6/man /usr/local/man

WARNING: makewhatis in Caldera 1.0 takes about 30 minutes on my
486DX66.  I have a modified version of makewhatis so that it does
exactly the same job in only 1.5 minutes. My modified version is now
available as part of man-1.4g (man-1.4g.tar.gz) and above:

 ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Manual-pagers

To use the Glimpse full text searching, you will need to install
glimpse in /usr/bin.  Redhat rpm users can get glimpse from 

 ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/non-free/glimpse-3.0-1.i386.rpm

The glimpse home ftp site is cs.arizona.edu.  N.B. glimpse is not
freely redistributable for commercial use, I'd be very interested in a
more liberal alternative.  Having installed glimpse, you will need to
build a glimpse index in /var/man2html.  This doesn't take too long -
about 3 minutes on my 486DX2/66 16MB machine.  As root do:

 /usr/bin/glimpseindex -z -H /var/man2html /usr/man/man* /usr/X11R6/man/man* \
     /usr/local/man/man* /opt/man/man*
 chmod ugo+r /var/man2html/.glimpse*

The -z option causes glimpse to apply any filters (for decompression etc)
specified in /var/man2html/.glimpse_filters.

This could be set up as a cron job in /etc/crontab, e.g. (the following
must be all on one line):

  21 04 * * 1 root /usr/bin/glimpseindex -z -H /var/man2html /usr/man/man* 
      /usr/X11R6/man/man* /usr/local/man/man* /opt/man/man* ;
      chmod +r /var/man2html/.glimpse*

If you don't want to use glimpse you can edit the man.html file that 
the package installs in /home/http/html/man.html, and remove the 
references to full text searches and glimpse.  This file can also be
edited to include any local instructions you might wish to include.

The scripts may generate errors to the httpd error log
/var/log/httpd/error_log.  The man binary (used to obtain the man-path
by some of the scripts) seems to always think it's talking to a tty,
and tries to obtain the screen size, resulting in the following error
log entries:

  TIOCGWINSZ
  failed : Bad file number

To serve man pages to remote hosts, all that is required is a httpd 
daemon that sets the environment variable SERVER_NAME correctly.

END OF QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

Vh-man2html was was written by Richard Verhoeven (NL:5482ZX35) at
the Eindhoven University of Technology (Email: rcb5@win.tue.nl).  The
original source is available from his web page at:

 http://wsinwp01.win.tue.nl:1234/maninfo.html

There are other man2html programs around - Richard's page has links to
several of them.  Richard's man2html has some useful features for
Caldera/RedHat Linux -

  Works from the troff/nroff source pages.
    With linux we almost always have the man source.
    Doesn't have to run man+tbl+eqn+nroff to generate output.
    Because man isn't run, no catman pages are generated.
    Accurate - doesn't have to guess from the man output.
    Does tables (eg man ascii) (but doesn't do eqn - few pages use eqn).
  Written in C - efficient speed/memory usage.
    Fast enough not to need a cache.
  Intelligent 
    Makes good guesses on where to find pages.
    Creates links for man pages and include files.

Richard's original program copes with pages formatted with the man
macros.  I've enhanced it by adding translations for the mandoc macros
used in the BSD man pages.  BSD mandoc pages in Caldera/Redhat
include Mail, ftp, telnet, rlogin, and lpr and other printer man
pages - so they're pretty important.  

I don't have any documentation on the mandoc macros, so I've had to
guess what they intend, by looking at man source, man output and the
gnroff macro definitions.  I've tested it on all the BSD mandoc pages
in Section 1 that I could find.  It works reasonable well.  There are
still minor formatting glitches to do with punctuation placement.
I checked the BSD mandoc with weblint, e.g. in tcsh/csh

 foreach i ( `egrep -l '^\.Bl' /usr/man/man1/* /usr/man/man8/*` )
     /home/httpd/cgi-bin/man2html $i > tmp/`basename $i`
 end
 weblint tmp/*

For broader testing:

 find /usr/man/man* -name '*.[0-9]' \
 -printf "echo %p; /home/httpd/cgi-bin/man2html %p |weblint -x netscape -\n" \
 | sh \
 |& tee weblint.log

If you want to sample the spectrum of mandoc translation, look at
any of the pages the above grep locates, telnet, lpc, and mail
are good examples.

For full details of my modifications to man2html.c see the patch
included in the source archive.

Here's a summary of the rpm's components:

  1)  man.html       - Main page or access to man2html and man indexes.
  2)  man2html       - CGI binary that converts man pages to html.
  3)  manwhatis      - CGI script for a name and synopsis index organised
                       by manual section
  4)  mansec         - CGI script for a name only index for each section.
  5)  mansearch      - Glimpse full text searching.
  6)  mansearch.html - Main page or access to man2html and man indexes.
  7)  netscape-man   - Front end that starts, or talks to, a running netscape.
  8)  /var/ma2html   - Cache directory for indexes and glimpse indexes.

All my scripts are written in awk.  In detail...

The manwhatis script creates section contents html files by looking
for whatis files along the man path.  Each whatis entry is translated
to a man2html link.  Manwhatis caches it's output in
/var/man2html/whatis-[0-9].html.  The cache will be regenerated if any
whatis file in the man path is updated (eg touch /usr/man/whatis).

The mansec script lists the names of all manual pages for a given
section by using find on the man path.  It caches its output in
/var/man2html/manindex-[0-9].html.  The cache will be regenerated if
any associated man[0-9] directory in the man path is updated.

The mansearch script uses glimpse to get back a list of files and
matches which it links back to the actual man pages.  The mansearch
script is not pure awk.  It's starts out as a shell script to ensure
that the parameters are safely passed to awk.  I think it's secure,
but I'm not a cgi script expert.

To build and install man2html, the scripts, and man.html from the
source archive - edit the Makefile and then:

 make install

To build binary and source rpms, placing them under /usr/src/...

 make rpm

SECURITY
--------

I've modified the man2html C code so that it checks all client input
parameters for length and characters that need escaping.

Man2html will only return man or mandoc files resident in the man
hierarchy defined in /etc/man.config.

When man2html generates references to include files they are in the
form file: on the CLIENT host, not the server.

The parameters to the decompression programs are checked for any
nasties.

It is still possible for the contents of a man page to over-run
man2html's memory - so I guess a hacker might try to get you to
install a bogus man page in order to get man2html to do something
nasty.

The scripts check their parameters for anything suspicious.

The scripts and program write suspicious requests to stderr - so they
can be found in web server log files.
