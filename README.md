# nautilus
[![Pipeline status](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/commits/main)

This is the project of the [Files](https://apps.gnome.org/Nautilus/) app, a file browser for
GNOME, internally known by its historical name `nautilus`.

## Supported version
Only the latest version of Files as provided upstream is supported. Try out the [Flatpak nightly](https://welcome.gnome.org/en/app/Nautilus/#installing-a-nightly-build) installation before filling issues to ensure the installation is reproducible and doesn't have downstream changes on it. In case you cannot reproduce in the nightly installation, don't hesitate to file an issue in your distribution. This is to ensure the issue is well triaged and reaches the proper people.

## Contributing to nautilus

To build the development version of the Files app and hack on the code
see the [welcome guide](https://welcome.gnome.org/en/app/Nautilus/#getting-the-app-to-build).

Commit messages should follow the expected format [detailed here](https://handbook.gnome.org/development/commit-messages.html).

### Update default branch

The default development branch of nautilus has been renamed to `main`. To
update your local checkout, use:
```sh
git checkout master
git branch -m master main
git fetch
git branch --unset-upstream
git branch -u origin/main
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```

## Runtime dependencies
- [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap) installed. Used for security reasons.
- [Tracker (including tracker-miners)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/tracker) properly set up and with all features enabled. Used for fast search and metadata extraction, starred files and batch renaming.
