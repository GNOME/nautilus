This file contains build instructions for Nautilus, the GNOME shell
and file manager. At some point we probably should move these to
INSTALL or HACKING and put an explanation of what Nautilus is here in
README instead.

1: Hacking
==========

If you would like to hack on Nautilus, or have patches, please send
mail to the Nautilus maintainer: Darin Adler <darin@eazel.com>.
Patches should also be sent to the Nautilus mailing list:
<nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com>

The HACKING file contains other things you should know when hacking on
Nautilus and when contributing code. Please, make sure you check the
coding style document in docs/style-guide.html and other documents
found in the "docs" directory.

===============
2: Introduction
===============

To build Nautilus without interfering with an existing GNOME install,
you will need to build several components either from CVS or from 
tarballs into a separate prefix. Detailed instructions on how
to accomplish this are available in section 4.

==============================
3: Distribution-specific notes
==============================

The following describes the libraries that Nautilus hackers use for
development and what we have tested with. At the moment, we make no
guarantees one way or another about whether Nautilus will work with
other versions.

You will also need the library package that is associated with each
development package, these versions are for Red Hat 6.2 and Debian
"potato":

library         Red Hat                     Debian                          approx. version
--------------  ------------------------    ------------------------------  ------------------
audiofile       audiofile-devel-0.1.9-3     libaudiofile-dev (0.1.9-0.1)    0.1.9
esound          esound-0.2.20               ?                               0.2
libc            glibc-devel-2.1.3-15        libc6-dev (2.1.3-10)            2.1.3
libc++          egcs-c++-1.1.2-30           libstdc++2.10-dev (2.95.2-12)   2.9.0, 2.10
libjpeg         libjpeg-devel-6b-10         libjpeg62-dev (6b-1.2)          6b 1.0-1.2
libpng          libpng-devel-1.0.5-3        libpng2-dev (1.0.5-1)           1.0.5
libtiff         libtiff-devel-3.5.4-5       libtiff3g-dev (3.5.4-5)         3.5.4
libungif        libungif-devel-4.1.0-4      libungif3g-dev (3.0-3)          3.0 or 4.1.0
Xlib            XFree86-devel-3.3.6-20      xlib6g-dev (3.3.6-7)            3.3.6
zlib            zlib-devel-1.1.3-6          zlib1g-dev (1.1.3-5)            1.1.3
freetype2       freetype2-devel-1.0beta8    ?                               1.0beta8

Other modules for Red Hat users:

        - For most modules, the versions in Red Hat 6.1 or 6.2 will do (listed above).
        - ORBit requires popt-1.5, which can be fetched from:

        ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/popt-1.5-0.45.i386.rpm
        ftp://ftp.valinux.com/pub/mirrors/redhat/redhat/redhat-6.2/i386/RedHat/RPMS/popt-1.5-0.48.i386.rpm

        - FreeType packages are available here:

        http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat62/freetype2/freetype-2.0.1-4.i386.rpm
        http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat62/freetype2/freetype-devel-2.0.1-4.i386.rpm

Replace "redhat62" with "redhat70" if you are using RedHat Linux 7.0.

Other modules for Debian users: using potato, or possibly woody

If you need to get a copy of popt from source: 

        CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.rpm.org:/cvs/devel
        The default password is a carriage return.  You should do a cvs co popt

Which RPM version you need depends on your distribution. If you have
Red Hat 6.2, you need at least 3.0.4. If you have Red Hat 7.0, you
need 4.0. Unfortunately, the released rpms from RedHat have bug (a
header file is missing), so for Red Hat 7.0 you will need the Eazel
Hacking rpm's for RPM, available from:

        http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat70/rpm/

=====================
4: Compiling from cvs
=====================

NOTE: Instructions on compiling from tarballs should be extracted from
the copy of Nautilus inside the tarball, not here in CVS.

Compiling from cvs a lot of work, and some packages may not compile at
any given moment when you check them out.

First, make sure you have installed the packages detailed below. If
you are running GNOME from binaries (Helix Code or your native
distribution binaries), please make sure you have installed the
corresponding development packages. (i.e.: the *-devel packages which
provide the necessary C header files.

Then, make sure you have no old version of the packages nautilus
depends on on your system. You can check the version of the relevant
packages by trying to execute "package-config --version" (ie:
gnome-config --version will report gnome-libs version, gconf-config
--version will report gconf's version).

The following lists the packages and the versions that are required.

    module             branch             configure options
    ------             ------             -----------------
    popt:              <1.5, not from GNOME CVS, see above>
    rpm                <see above>
    glib:              glib-1-2
    gtk+:              gtk-1-2
    imlib:             HEAD
    gnome-xml:         LIB_XML_1_BRANCH
    ORBit:             orbit-stable-0-5
    gnome-libs:        gnome-libs-1-0     --enable-prefer-db1
    gnome-http:        HEAD
    xml-i18n-tools:    HEAD
    oaf:               oaf-stable-0-6
    gconf:             gconf-1-0          --disable-debug
    gdk-pixbuf:        HEAD               --enable-canvas-pixbuf
    gnome-print:       GNOME_PRINT_0_25
    control-center     control-center-1-0
    gnome-vfs:         gnome-vfs-1
    bonobo:            HEAD
    ammonite           HEAD
    medusa:            HEAD
    nautilus:          HEAD

One difference between tarball and cvs compilation is that when you
get stuff from cvs, you don't get a configure script. This script has
to be generated.  This script is usually generated with the help of
another script available from cvs named "autogen.sh". For those
interested, "autogen.sh" will run in turn aclocal, automake, autoconf
and configure. You thus need versions of the GNU tools for the
following packages:

        package         version       command
        -------         -------       -------
        automake        1.4           automake --version
        autoconf        2.13          autoconf --version

Earlier versions might work but no one has tested them.

You will need to create the ${prefix}/share/aclocal directory
before compiling any package and setup the following environment
variable:

        export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="$ACLOCAL_FLAGS -I ${prefix}/share/aclocal"

We assume you want to install these packages in another prefix than
/usr since you want to keep a working system. For the following, we
assume you are installing in /usr/local. ie: ${prefix}=/usr/local

Redefine your PATH environment variable:
        export PATH=$PATH:${prefix}/bin

Redefine your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${prefix}/lib

Redefine your GNOME_PATH environment variable:

        export GNOME_PATH=$GNOME_PATH:${prefix}

In the order defined above and with the specific options detailed
above for each package, you should run the autogen scripts:

        ./autogen.sh --prefix=${prefix} <special-options>

Then:

        make

Then get root and:

        make install.

===============================
5: Issues when running Nautilus
===============================

There's a script named nautilus-clean.sh, at the top level of the
Nautilus sources. If OAF or GConf changes, you may need to run this
script to get Nautilus to work properly. One way to invoke it is like
this:

        ./nautilus-clean.sh -x

==================
6: Mozilla support
==================

Nautilus includes support for browsing HTML content on the local
computer as well as remote web servers. HTML content is handled by the
Nautilus Mozilla component. This component can be optionally built
with Nautilus. It is automatically enabled at configure time if
Mozilla development libraries are detected on your system.

Mozilla RPMs can be found here:

	http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat62/mozilla/mozilla-0.7-11.i386.rpm
	http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat62/mozilla/mozilla-devel-0.7-11.i386.rpm

Replace "redhat62" with "redhat70" if you are using RedHat Linux 7.0.

After installing these rpms, you can build nautilus with Mozilla
support as follows:

        cd nautilus
        rm -f config.cache config.status
        ./configure

The configure script should automatically detect and use the Mozilla
development libraries.

Alternatively, you can build Mozilla from source and use that.  Lets
say that you built Mozilla in /foo/bar.  You can build nautilus with
support for that Mozilla build as follows:

        cd nautilus
        rm -f config.cache config.status
        ./configure --with-mozilla-lib-place=/foo/bar/mozilla/dist/bin
            --with-mozilla-include-place=/foo/bar/mozilla/dist/include

NOTE: The above configure command should be issued in one line. It is
split into two lines in this document for readability.

NOTE: If you are building mozilla from source (NOT from the rpm), you
need to do some environment setup for the Mozilla component:

        export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/foo/bar/mozilla/dist/bin
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/bar/mozilla/dist/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you experience linking problems (e.g. undefined reference to
`nsString type_info node'), please note that both applications
(mozilla and nautilus) must be compiled not only with the same version
of compiler, but also with the same compiler flags. Download the right
mozilla package for your distribution (see upper).

If you have built Mozilla from source, Mozilla by default adds
CXXFLAGS -fno-rtti and -fno-exceptions or -fno-handle-exceptions
(depends on gcc version).  You have two chances to make things in
sync:

1) Compile mozilla with this .mozconfig script: (You must place it in
your home directory):

        # sh
        # Build configuration script
        #
        # See http://www.mozilla.org/build/unix.html for build instructions.
        #

        # Options for 'configure' (same as command-line options).
        ac_add_options --disable-tests
        ac_add_options --disable-debug
        ac_add_options --enable-strip-libs
        ac_add_options --enable-cpp-rtti
        ac_add_options --disable-mailnews
        ac_add_options --enable-optimize

2) Configure mozilla with standard configure script and compile it.
Before configuring Nautilus set proper CXXFLAGS. For example with
latest gcc it means:

        CXXFLAGS='-fno-rtti -fno-exceptions'
        export CXXFLAGS

For more, see configure.in in mozilla source. You can save some space
by disabling RTTI.

As an alternative, if you don't want to use the Nautilus web page
viewer that uses Mozilla, you can disable the Mozilla component (even
if Mozilla development libraries are installed in your system) as
follows:

        ./configure --disable-mozilla-component

==================
7: FreeType issues
==================

Nautilus includes support for rendering anti aliased text (smooth
mode).For smooth mode to work, Nautilus needs to detect and use
FreeType2 in your system.

To learn more about FreeType2, please see:

        http://freetype.sourceforge.net/

If you are using a RedHat 6.x or greater system, then you can easily
add FreeType2 support by installing the rpms found here:

        http://developer.eazel.com/eazel-hacking/updates/redhat62/freetype2

Replace "redhat62" with "redhat70" if you are using RedHat Linux 7.0.
