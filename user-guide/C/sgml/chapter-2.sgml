        <title>Customizing the Nautilus Interface</title>


	<para>
	Nautilus has been designed to be highly configurable, 
	both to suit the desire of users for customized decor, 
	and to suit the needs of users at 
	different levels of expertise.
	</para>

	<para>
	Chapter two is presented in four sections:

	<sect1 id="ch2-settings">
	<title>Choosing and Customizing User Settings</title>

	<para>
	User settings 
	control performance and design variables, as well 
	as certain appearance variables that are related 
	more toward system function than simple decor.
	</para>

	<para>
	There are three levels of user settings to choose 
	from: beginner, intermediate, and advanced; the 
	level of information displayed increasing with 
	each step. In addition, the two higher-level 
	settings are both highly customizable.
	</para>

	<title>Accessing and Choosing User Settings</title>

	<para>
	To access user settings, click the colored icon on 
	the far right of the menu bar (Figure 1). 
	</para>

	</figure>

	<para>
	The drop-down menu presents the three levels of 
	choices, and the choice of customizing the inter-
	mediate and advanced levels.
	</para>

	<para>
	Figure 2 and 3 present the most obvious of the 
	differences between the default beginner or intermediate, 
	and the advanced display settings. In 
	both cases Nautilus is looking at the /home/john 
	directory. Home directories typically have a 
	number of hidden files. In Figure 2, at the 
	beginner (or intermediate) setting, only four 
	directories are visible. In Figure 3, at the 
	advanced setting, an additional 15 hidden directories 
	are visible.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch2-settings-editing">
	<title>Editing User Settings</title>

	<para>
	The Edit Settings menu item, which is used to edit 
	the intermediate and advanced user levels, 
	presents the same choices for both. The choices 
	are listed under six headings:

	<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>
	Folder Views
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	Sidebar Panels

	</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	</para>

	<para>
	Figure 4 shows the choices in the first heading: 
	Folder Views. Here the user can choose to have 
	Nautilus open a file in a separate window, activate 
	items with a single or a double click, and display 
	hidden and backup files.
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Customizing Directory Views</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-edit-settings-folder" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	The next heading down the list, Sidebar Panels, 
	lets the user choose which panels should appear in 
	the sidebar. Appearance, the third heading, allows 
	the user to choose between smoother (but 
	slower) graphics, or rough edges and speed. It 
	also allows a choice of fonts with which to 
	display file names and other information.
	</para>

	<para>
	Search (Figure 5), lets users configure the file 
	manager to search for files by text only, or also by 
	their properties (slower), to optionally do slow, 
	complete searches, and to change, if desired, 
	Nautilus default web search location.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Navigation heading allows the user to change 
	the local machines default home location, and 
	also allows the user to setup an HTTP proxy.

	<title>Customizing File Layout and Icon Appearance</title>

	<para>
	The layout of files in the main window can be a 
	major factor in the ease and speed of file identification. 
	The default method of laying out files, 
	alphabetically according to file names, is appropriate 
	under certain conditions, i.e.: when the 
	files in a directory are all of a similar type, with 
	well designed names following a similar pattern. 
	However, file identification using this layout can 
	be tedious and difficult in a directory holding 
	large numbers of files of disparate types, and 
	without an obvious naming convention.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch2-file-layout">
	<title>Choices in File Layout</title>

	<para>
	Nautilus addresses this issue by giving the user 
	several choices of file layout. Figure 6 shows the 
	Lay out items pull-down sub-menu (under View), the 
	range of layout choices available, and a directory 
	with several different file types arranged alpha-
	betically.
	</para>


	<figure>
	<title>Layout Choices, and an Unoptimized Alphabetical Layout</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-view-layout-menu" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>In this example, a more sensible layout would be 
	by type. The result of this choice of layout 
	is shown in Figure 7.

	<title>A More Logical Layout, by Type</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-home-john-mydoc" scale="50"></graphic>

	Once a method of layout is chosen, the presentation 
	can be further optimized with the Use 
	Tighter Layout and Reversed Order options.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2 id="ch2-file-icons">
	<title>Customizing Icon Captions</title>

	<para>
	Icon captions and appearance can also be 
	adjusted. A file caption must always start with the 
	file name; however, both the type of information 
	and the order of information displayed beneath 
	file names can be manipulated.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Icon Captions menu item is found under Edit 
	on the tool bar. When clicked, it displays the Icon 
	Captions menu, Figure 8.
	</para>

	<title>Determining the Order of Icon Information</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-icon-captions-alone" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	The three menu-buttons reflect the order of information 
	displayed in the icon caption. Each button 
	displays identical information, from file size to 
	MIME type, ten types of information in all. The 
	type chosen by the top button will appear first, 
	beneath the file name, the type chosen by the 
	second will appear next, etc. Figure 9 shows an 
	enlarged file image (to 400%), with the captioned 
	information reflecting the order in the accompanying 
	Icon Caption sub-menu.

	<title>Differentiating a Directory with a Customized Icon</title>

	<para>
	The actual appearance of an icon can be replaced 
	by another useful if, for instance, you want to 
	identify a certain directory by the type of files it 
	contains. The method used is to drag and drop the 
	icon in the main window which you want for a 
	replacement, to the icon in the sidebar that you 
	want to replace. An example can be seen in Figure 
	10, where an icon representing a portrait of 
	Beethoven has been used to identify the music
	directory.

	<para>
	Icon appearance can also be enhanced by the use 
	of emblems. Click on a file with the right mouse 
	button, and choose Show Properties. In the 
	resulting properties window, click the middle tab, 
	Emblems. Any and all of the emblems may be 
	added to a files iconic appearance. In the 
	example shown in Figure 11, the Draft emblem 
	has been added to a text file.

	<title>Configuring Applications</title>

	<para>
	As we have seen in Chapter One, a file can easily 
	be opened by its application from within Nautilus, 
	relieving the user of the tedious extra steps of 
	first starting the application, then finding the 
	desired file. Nautilus does this by assigning 
	certain adefault applications to certain file types. 
	This too is customizable by the user.
	</para>

	<para>
	Clicking on a file--in the example below, a JPEG 
	file--with the right mouse button, brings up a 
	menu with the item, Open With. Moving the 
	mouse pointer to this opens a sub-menu (Figure 12).
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>The Open With Sub-Menu</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-right-click-open-with" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	In this example, Nautilus offers to open the file 
	with its default image viewer, or the user can 
	choose another viewer or application. 
	</para>

	<para>
	Suppose the user wanted to customize Nautilus to 
	always open JPEG files with The Gimp (which is 
	both a viewer and an editor). In this case, the user 
	would click Other Application.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Open with Other window which appears 
	(Figure 13), shows the user the current application(s) 
	setup for opening files. 
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Choosing an Application</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch2-open-with-other" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	In Figure 13, The Gimp is present, but is not in 
	the menu for opening JPEG files. To place it in 
	the menu and make sure it is used as the default 
	viewer for JPEG files, click the Modify button, 
	and choose the second selection (Figure 14).

	<para>
	A deeper level of configuration can be obtained 
	by clicking the Go There button on the Open with 
	Other menu. That opens the GNOME Control 
	Center to the File Types and Programs screen. For 
	an explanation of how to associate programs with 
	certain file types, see the GNOME Users Guide.

	<title>Customizing Nautilus Appearance</title>

	<para>
	Many users are not content to stare at a <emphasis>default</emphasis>
	desktop decor: they want to customize it 
	according to taste. For this, a wide range of 
	backgrounds, colors, emblems and themes is 
	available, and, should the user wish, they can add 
	their own.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch2-apearance-colors">
	<title>Backgrounds, Colors and Emblems</title>

	<para>
	To change the desktop decor, click on Edit on the 
	menu bar, and choose Customize. The Nautilus 
	Customization Options window appears.
	</para>

	<para>
	Each background, color, and emblem can be 
	applied by simply dragging it to the desire 
	window or file with the mouse. In the example in 
	Figure 15, the satin background has been applied 
	to the main window, while the color ruby has been 
	dragged and dropped into the sidebar. Finally, the 
	file <filename>pluck.wav</filename> has been embelished with a 
	green, heart-shaped <emphasis>Favorite</emphasis> emblem.

	Selecting one of the four different themes applies 
	the new theme while the selector window is still
