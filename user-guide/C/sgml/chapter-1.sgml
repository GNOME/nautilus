	This chapter presents the basic elements of the 
	Nautilus file manager, and its basic file functions 
	and features. Nautilus is designed to make file 
	management transparent and intuitive-and, in 
	the process, more productive.

	<title>Launching Nautilus</title>

	<para>
	Nautilus can be launched from three locations: 
	from the GNOME main menu, where the Nautilus 
	menu item can be found under Applications; from 
	the GNOME desktop itself; or from the Panel.
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Nautilus Icon</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-nautiluslogo" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	If you wish to put the Nautilus icon (Figure 1), on 
	your desktop, select the Nautilus menu item and, 
	holding down the left mouse button, drag it to the 
	desktop.
	</para>

	<para>
	Probably the easiest way to launch Nautilus is 
	from the GNOME panel (Figure 2). To place the 
	icon there, drag the menu item, as above, to an 
	empty space on the panel at the bottom of the 
	screen. This method has the advantage of speed: 
	the panel is nearly always present, and is at most 
	only a click away. The icon itself needs only one 
	click to launch Nautilus.
	</para>

	<figure>

	<para>
	To launch Nautilus, click once on the menu item, 
	or panel icon, or twice on the desktop icon.
	</para>

	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="ch1-elements">
	<title>Nautilus Elements</title>

	<para>
	The major elements of the Nautilus file manager 
	include, in the upper part, the menu bar, tool bar 
	and location bar, and below, the sidebar and the 
	main window (Figure 3).
	</para>

	<para>
	The menu bar is used to access the pull-down 
	menus, which are the most complete source of 
	Nautilus tools and features. The tool bar provides 
	quick access to Nautilus most common 
	navigation and search tools, and Eazel Services. 
	The location bar displays system directory 
	location, LAN location, and Internet location-
	depending on where Nautilus is looking at the 
	given moment.
	</para>

	<para>
	The main window is the main viewing area for the 
	systems directories and files, as well as the area 
	where directories and files are generally manipu-
	lated. It is capable of showing files in several 
	formats, and includes file information such as 
	size, type, and date last modified.
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Main Nautilus Elements</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-icon-view-demo" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	The sidebar provides a tree view of directories 
	and sub-directories, as well as a history view 
	(recently viewed files and directories), and a 
	variety of Linux help documents.
	</para>

	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="ch1-navigation">
	<title>Navigating and Viewing The System</title>


	<para>
	Nautilus offers several methods to navigate the 
	system. Typing a directory address into the 
	location bar will point Nautilus toward that 
	location. The directional arrows on the tool bar 
	provide a simpler method to navigate back, 
	forward, and up through the system: they function 
	exactly as in a browser. Clicking on a directory 
	icon in the main window will open that directory. 
	Finally, clicking the collapsible branches of the 
	sidebars tree view allows the user to graphically 
	view and navigate the directory tree.
	</para>

	<para>
	The file manager minimizes the necessity of
	opening applications by identifying many file 
	types graphically. Viewer components allow 
	several common document types to be displayed 
	without launching a separate application, and a 
	zoom feature provides one-click zooming in and 
	out in the main window. Sound files in certain 
	common formats can even be previewed by 
	simply passing the mouse over the file icon.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch1-navigation-hardware">
	<title>The Initial Screen and Hardware Overview</title>

	<para>
	The first screen to appear (Figure 4), shows the 
	contents of your home directory (note: the first screen
	will be the Nautilus sub-directory if the Beginner mode was 
	selected). In this example,
	the user has logged in under their own name-
	John-so the home directory is /home/john. 
	Linux follows the UNIX convention for home 
	directories: if the user had logged in as Susan, the 
	home directory would be /home/susan; when 
	logged in as the root user, the home directory is root.
	</para>

	<para>
	The file manager identifies this directory in two 
	ways: as a traditional command line directory 
	address in the location bar, and as a captioned 
	folder icon in the sidebar.
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>The Start Screen</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-icon-view-150" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	Among the contents of the screen are a Nautilus 
	folder. This folder, when clicked, takes the user to 
	/home/john/Nautilus, Figure 5. Among the 
	contents of the folder are: a small HTML file 
	containing information about Nautilus; a services 
	icon which, when double-clicked, takes you 
	directly to Eazel Services (covered in Chapter 
	Three), and a computer icon which leads to a 
	Hardware Overview of your system, Figure 6.

	Services Icons.</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-home" scale="50"></graphic>

	<para>
	The hardware overview shows the details of the 
	computers central processor unit, including the 
	manufacturer, the model, the calculated speed in 
	MHz and the cache size. It also shows the amount 
	of system RAM, and the models of the hard 
	drive(s) and CD player.

	<sect2 id="ch1-navigation-refresh">
	<title>Using the Navigation, Refresh and Home Buttons</title>
	
	<para>
	The navigation buttons on the left side of the tool 
	bar-Back, Forward, Up, Refresh and Home-are 
	used in a similar way to the navigation buttons on 
	a web browser (Figure 7).
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Navigation Arrows on the Tool Bar</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-toolbar" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	The three left-most buttons allow navigation 
	through the file system by both time and 
	direction.
	</para>

	<para>
	The back and forward buttons allow the user to 
	revisit directories and files which the user has 
	already accessed during the current session. This 
	is navigation through time. The previous example 
	illustrates this: clicking on the back button from 
	the hardware overview screen will take the user 
	back to the /home/john screen, but once there, 
	the back button will be dimmed out: there is no 
	further back in time to go in this session.
	</para>

	<para>
	Similarly, clicking the forward button at this point 
	would take the user once again to the /home/
	john/Nautilus screen.
	</para>

	<para>
	The up button navigates upward through the 
	directory hierarchy. This is navigation by 
	direction. As an example, in the previous section 
	it is impossible-solely with the back button-to 
	go up through the file system further than /home/
	john. However, by clicking the up button, the user 
	can navigate first to /home, and then all the way 
	to /.
	</para>

	<para>
	Clicking the refresh button refreshes the view of 
	the current directory.
	</para>

	<para>
	The home button will always take the user to the 
	current sessions home directory. If the user has 
	logged on as root, then the home button, when 
	clicked, will open /root. If the user has logged on 
	as Laura, the directory opened will be /home/
	laura. Note: if the user is running in Beginner mode, 
	clicking the home button will open the Nautilus sub-directory.  
	This is, as are so many features in 
	Nautilus, customizable-see Chapter Two.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch1-navigation-icons-list">
	<title>Viewing as Icons, or as a List</title>

	<para>
	Although directories and files are by default
	viewed, in the main window, as icons, there is 
	some advantage to viewing them as a list. At a 
	normal magnification level, more information will 
	be displayed in list view, such as the files type 
	and modification date. To change the view style, 
	click on the View as Icons button, to the bottom-right 
	of the tool bar (Figure 8), and choose List.
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="ch1-view-as" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	The list view still includes representative icons, 
	but the extra space used by the extra description 
	means the icons must be minimized. The Date 
	Modified column is particularly clear, with 
	descriptive terms used where the latest modifi-
	cation of the file or directory is within the last 
	week (Figure 9).

	<sect2 id="ch1-navigation-tree">
	<title>Using Tree View in the Sidebar</title>

	<para>
	Tree view refers to a collapsible list of directories, 
	sub-directories and files. In Nautilus, it is 
	available in the sidebar. The advantage of tree 
	view is that it allows the user to clearly observe 
	the directory structure at a glance, thus simplifying 
	directory and file administration.
	</para>

	<para>
	To activate tree view, click the Tree tab at the 
	bottom of the sidebar screen. At first, the tree 
	may be collapsed, showing a single folder (Figure 
	10).
	</para>

	<figure>
	<title>Collapsed Tree View at Root</title>
	<graphic fileref="ch1-tree-slash" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	To expand the directory structure, click once on 
	the right arrow pointing toward the folder. The 
	arrow will immediately point down, and the root 
	directories appear in the sidebar. Clicking any 
	sub-directory arrow will expand that sub-
	directory, but not automatically expand the view 
	in the main window. Notice in Figure 11 that 
	although the tree in the sidebar is expanded to /T/
	ARCHIVE/Redhat/ETC, the main window and 
	the location bar are still showing the folders 
	within /home/john.
	</para>

	<para>
	(Also notice that, when necessary, vertical and 
	horizontal scroll bars appear automatically on the 
	sidebar panels).

	</figure>

	<para>
	To synchronize the displays-that is, to display 
	the contents of the same directory in both the 
	sidebar and the main window-simply click on 
	the desired folder icon in the sidebars tree view 
	(Figure 12). In this illustration, the user has 
	clicked on the icon representing the directory 
	/demo in the sidebar. Both the location bar and 
	the main window now reflect this location, with 
	the main window displaying the contents of the 
	demo directory in icon view.

	<para>
	Exploring the directory tree within the sidebar 
	alone is usually faster than exploring it within the 
	main window. To expand directories without 
	updating the main window, click on the small 
	right arrows in tree view. In the example shown in 
	Figure 13, the /etc directory has been expanded, 
	as has the /X11 subdirectory. Beneath that are 
	several more subdirectories, and the XF86Config 
	file, which configures the X server.

	<graphic fileref="ch1-tree-etc" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>

	<para>
	There may be times when the directory tree is so 
	expanded, the user may lose sight of the upper 
	branches. In such a situation, the user can either 
	scroll with the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom 
	of the sidebar, or, by holding down the left mouse 
	button, enlarge the sidebar by dragging its right-
	hand edge into the main window area.

	<title>Zooming in the Main Window</title>

	<para>
	In a screen crowded with directory and file icons, 
	the user may wish to zoom in to confirm a file 
	name or type. The zoom feature enables this 
	within the main window.
	</para>

	<para>
	Figure 14 is an example of a screen crowded with

	Somewhere in the window is the README file 
	for the Chips & Technology graphics card. To use 
	the zoom feature to find this more easily, the user 
	simply clicks on the + sign of the zoom control
	to the right of the location bar (Figure 15).

        The result-shown in Figure 16, after two clicks 
        on the + sign, bringing magnification up to 
        150%-is a far more easily read display, with the 
        various graphics card types clearly identifiable. 
        The Chips & Technology README file is on the 
        left. This example also shows how greater magnification 
        leads to more file and directory information displayed.

	There may be times, especially on computers with 
	large displays, when, instead of using the vertical 
	scroll bar to find a file or directory, it may be 
	faster to zoom out, and view a larger area. To do 
	this, click on the minus sign to the left of the plus

	<title>Viewing and Opening Files Within Nautilus</title>

	<para>
	Certain common file types can be identified, read, 
	or, in the case of music files, heard, from within 
	Nautilus, without having to open the files application.
	</para>

	<para>
	Graphics files of many common types are represented as thumbnails--realistic iconic representations of their content.  To inspect them more closely, without opening their related application, 
	the user can enlarge them using the zoom feature.
	</para>

	<para>
	Other types of files use different viewing 
	methods. Many text files can be read just by 
	clicking on them once in the main window. This is 
	both faster than opening up a separate console, or 
	application, and it also uses fewer system 
	resources. Figure 17 shows an example using the

	<para>Manipulating directories and files is one of the 
	most basic of all file manager features. Nautilus 
	can be used to graphically move, copy, duplicate, 
	rename and delete files, and to create new and 
	rename existing directories. It can also be used as 
	a search engine, on the local machine, the LAN, 
	and the web. Finally, in Nautilus the user can 
	graphically change a files permissions-a great 
	advance over the command line CHMOD method.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch1-files-moving">
	<title>Moving and Copying Files</title>

	<para>
	These two file management activities are 
	performed by opening two Nautilus windows, one 
	for the source location and one for the destination.
	</para>

	<para>
	Open a new Nautilus window by clicking on File 
	on the menu bar, and choosing the first menu 
	item: New Window (Figure 26).
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="ch1-new-window" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	To move a file, simply drag it from the source 
	window to the destination window, with the left 
	mouse button depressed. For options, drag the file 
	with the right mouse button: this gives the choices 
	of either moving or copying the file, or of 
	creating a link.
	</para>

	<para>
	An example of a successful file copy operation is 
	shown in Figure 27. The pluck.wav file has been 
	copied from the /home/john directory (the 
	source), in the lower-right Nautilus window, to 
	the /home/john/music directory, in the upper-left 
	Nautilus window.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch1-files-duplicating">
	<title>Duplicating, Renaming and Deleting Files, and Creating 
	Directories</title>

	<para>
	Duplicating a file is accomplished by either 
	clicking on the file with the right mouse button, 
	and selecting Duplicate, or by first selecting the 
	file and then selecting Duplicate from the File 
	pull-down menu on the menu bar (Figure 28). 
	Notice in the illustration that the duplicate file is 
	identified by the tag (copy) next to the file name.
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="ch1-duplicate" scale="50"></graphic>
	</figure>


	<para>
	Renaming a file is accomplished in a similar 
	manner. Choose the same menu by either means, 
	and click on Rename. Then simply type the new 
	name into the file caption.
	</para>

	<para>
	Deleting a file, in Nautilus, means moving it to 
	the trash folder which Nautilus creates upon 
	installation. A file may be deleted either by 
	dragging and dropping it into the trash folder, or 
	by selecting the file, opening the same menu as 
	above, and choosing Move to Trash.
	</para>

	<para>
	Note that moving a file to the trash folder does 
	not delete it from the system. It is still available, 
	and can still be retrieved, in case the user has 
	trashed it mistakenly. Permanent file deletion is 
	accomplished by clicking the Empty Trash item in 
	the File menu.
	</para>

	<para>
	A new subdirectory can be created (and/or 
	renamed), anywhere in the directory tree, by 
	selecting the parent directory and then pulling 
	down the File menu from the menu bar. Click on 
	New Folder, and the new subdirectory is created. 
	Just type in the name and hit the Enter key.
	</para>

	<sect2 id="ch1-files-find-search">
	<title>File Find and Web Search</title>

	<para>
	Nautilus' two search features, found on the tool 
	bar, enable the user both to find files on the local 
	machine and on mounted Samba shares, and to 
	locate information on the web.
	</para>

	<para>
	To search for a file either locally or on a Samba 
	LAN, click the Find button on the tool bar, and 
	type in the name of the desired file. Then click 
	the Find Them button.
	</para>

	<para>
	This is the simplest form of file search, but by 
	clicking the More Options button-several 
	times-no fewer than seven search variables 
	become available. Each variable in turn has its 
	own set of constraints. In this way it is possible to 
	narrow down, or refine a search very precisely 
	(Figure 29).

	<para>
	To search for information on the web, click on 
	the Web Search button on the tool bar. Nautilus is 
	transformed into a web browser, and Google is 
	presented in the main window (Figure 30).

	<title>Changing File Permissions</title>

	<para>
	To change a file's permissions, click with the 
	right mouse button on the file, and choose Show 
	Properties from the menu. The dialog box which 
	appears has three tabs. Choose the one labelled: 
	Permissions (Figure 31). Both the file's owner 
	and group settings can be changed, as can the 
	read, write, and execute permissions for each setting. 
	The text view and numeric view of the result 
	are automatically updated at the bottom of the box.

	This Users Manual is available from both the

	Contents tab at the bottom of the sidebar.

	<para>
	In addition to this manual, the Help Contents tab 
	provides easy access to many other Linux help 
	files in several different formats.
