   </para>

  <sect1 id="introdesktop">
   <title>The Nautilus Desktop</title>

   <para>
    The desktop is the background area of your screen. If Nautilus was
    pre-installed on your GNOME system, Nautilus draws the
    desktop. The desktop on your computer can look like your physical
    desktop - it can be full of folders, icons, and works in progress,
    or it can be clear. Nautilus lets you organize it the way
    you want.
   </para>

   <para>
    If Nautilus doesn't already draw the desktop on your system, do
    this:

    represents your home location, an Eazel Services icon that takes
    you to Eazel's Web site, and a Trash icon.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can create folders on the desktop or drag additional files
    and folders from the Nautilus window to the desktop. For instance,
    you can create a folder that contains your current projects and
    keep it on the desktop for easy access. You also mount disks (such
    as floppies or CD-ROMs) on the desktop.
   </para>

    When you first launch Nautilus, you'll see your home folder in the
    Nautilus window. Three areas of the Nautilus window contain
    information about your folder:
   </para>

   <para>
    <inlinegraphic fileref="figures/part-1"></inlinegraphic>

    Your home folder also appears on your desktop, represented by a
    house icon. Double-clicking the house icon opens a new Nautilus
    window with your home folder displayed.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note about the home folder: Depending on your user-level setting,
    your home folder may be the default Nautilus home folder, which
    contains basic information about your computer and pointers to
    some useful applications, or the home folder defined for you in
    your Linux settings (normally /home/<emphasis>your_name</emphasis>).

    You can use the Nautilus window to look at a file's contents

    viewer.

  <sect1 id="settings">
   <title>Setting Your User Level</title>

   <para>
    When you first lanched Nautilus, you were asked to choose your
    user level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. The user level
    dictates the amount of detail you see while navigating your files
    and folders:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Beginner: For users who have no previous experience
      with Linux or GNOME.

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Intermediate: For users who have had some experience with Linux
      or GNOME but don't want to see every detail of their
      system.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Advanced: For users who like to see every detail of
      their system, including the ugly stuff.
     </para>
    </listitem>

   <para>
    To change your user level, open the preferences menu and choose
    the level you want.

    One way to see the difference between the levels is to go to your
    home directory and then compare what you see as you select each
    level in turn. Be sure to return to the level with which you're
    comfortable when you're done.

    The preference settings adjust the appearance of Nautilus, the
    behavior of files and folders when you view and click them, the

   <title>What Are MIME Types?</title>

   <para>
    MIME types are a standard way to identify files so that they can
    be easily transmitted over the Internet. MIME stands for
    "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extention." Each type of file is
    assigned a specific MIME type. For instance, the MIME type for
    HTML files is "text/html," and the MIME type for JPEG files is
    "image/jpeg." A file's MIME type tells Internet applications such
    as browsers and email programs what type of file is being
    exchanged, how to encode it for transmission, and how to decode it
    when it arrives at its destination.
   </para>

   <para>
    Unless you've specified that a particular application or viewer
    should open a file, it normally opens automatically in an
    application that's appropriate for the type. For instance, a JPEG
    file normally opens automatically in a graphics application.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can choose which application or viewer opens automatically for
    a particular type of file. You can also set up new applications to
    handle particular types of files.
   </para>
