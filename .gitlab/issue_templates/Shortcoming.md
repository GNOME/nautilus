<!--
It's useful to know if the latest development version has the same shortcoming.
It can be installed alongside the regular version with these instructions:

1. Make sure that Flatpak is installed (see https://flatpak.org/setup )

2. Copy and run the following command in the Terminal or Console app:
   flatpak install --from https://nightly.gnome.org/repo/appstream/org.gnome.Nautilus.Devel.flatpakref

3. Launch the development version (normal Files logo with yellow and black stripes), e.g. with:
   flatpak run org.gnome.Nautilus.Devel
